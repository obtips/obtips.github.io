Dear Red,
```
亲爱的瑞德，
```
If you're reading this, you've gotten out. And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. You remember the name of the town, don't you? I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. I'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready.

```
如果你正在读这封信，那你已经出来了。而且如果你已经走了这么远的话，或许你会想着走得更远一点。你记得这个小镇的名字，对吧？我正需要个强力助手帮我把事业步入正轨。我会等着你的到来，而棋盘早就备好了。
```
Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well.

```
记住，瑞德。希望是个好东西，或许是最好的东西了，而且好的东西是不会消亡的。我期望这封信能到你手里，而你一切安好。
```
Your friend,
Andy
```
你的朋友
安迪
