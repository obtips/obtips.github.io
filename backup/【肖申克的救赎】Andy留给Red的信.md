Dear Red,

If you're reading this, you've gotten out. And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. You remember the name of the town, don't you? I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. I'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready.

Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well.

Your friend,
Andy

>记住，瑞德。希望是个好东西，或许是所有东西中最好的那个了，而且好的东西是不会消亡的。<br/>我期望这封信能到你手里，而你一切安好。
